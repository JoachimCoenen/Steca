= Steca: GUI overview

== Main window

Most of work with Steca is done in a single main window. The window has the usual
layout: a menu bar, a main working area with multiple panels, and a status bar.

== Dock widgets

The ''Files'', ''Datasets'', and ''Metadata'' panels are 'dock widgets'.
They can be 'docked' to either side of the window, or even overlapped to save space,
for example like so:

.{img img/mainwin2.png|main window}}

The three dock widgets can be hidden or shown, by selecting the ''[View/Files]'',
''[View/Datasets]'', and ''[View/Metadata]'' menu options. ''[View/Reset]''
shows the dock widgets in their original place.

== Menus

.The main window menu is organized in several submenus.
.A number of menu options are also available as tool buttons in the various
panels of the main window. The same icons that are on the tool buttons are also
shown in the menus, next to each respective menu text. Often used menu options
have associated keyboard hotkeys, shown right next to the menu text.

.The submenus are:
