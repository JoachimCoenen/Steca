= Steca: GUI overview

== Main window

Most of work with Steca is done in a single main window. The window has the usual
layout: a menu bar, a main working area with multiple panels, and a status bar.

== Dock widgets

The ''Files'', ''Datasets'', and ''Metadata'' panels are *dock widgets*.
They can be 'docked' to either side of the window, or even overlapped to save space,
for example like so:

{img:img/mainwin2.png|main window}}

The three dock widgets can be hidden or shown, by selecting the ''[View/Files]'',
''[View/Datasets]'', and ''[View/Metadata]'' menu options. ''[View/Reset]''
shows the dock widgets in their original place.

== Menus

.The main window menu is organized in several submenus.
.A number of menu options are also available as tool buttons in the various
panels of the main window. The same icons that are on the tool buttons are also
shown in the menus, next to each respective menu text. Often used menu options
have associated keyboard hotkeys, shown right next to the menu text.

.The submenus are:

=== File

--- table.border
[.nbr Add files…] [Opens a file selection dialog; adds selected data files to the session; load datasets (images and metadata) contained in the files.]
[.nbr Remove selected file(s)]	[Removes files selected in the ~Files~ panel and corresponding datasets from the session.]
[.nbr Enable correction file…]	[Controls correction of detector pixel sensitivity. If a (vanadium) correction file has not been yet loaded, a file can be selected and image data loaded. Typically, a correction file contains only a single image; if there are more than one image in the file, they will be collapsed into one by averaging intensities of the corresponding pixels. The correction can be enabled and disabled (switched on and off) by repeatedly selecting this option.]
[.nbr Remove correction file] [Removes the correction file from the session.]
[.nbr Load session…] [Clears the current session and loads (restores) a saved session from a session file.]
[.nbr Save session…] [Saves the current session to a session file. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.]
[.nbr Quit] [Ends the program.]
---

=== View

--- table.border
[.nbr Files] [Shows or hides the Files panel.]
[.nbr Datasets] [Shows or hides the Datasets panel.]
[.nbr Metadata] [Shows or hides the Metadata panel.]
[.nbr FullScreen] [Switches the window to a full screen mode and back.]
[.nbr Statusbar] [Shows or hides the status bar. (The status bar is used to display warnings and error messages.)]
[.nbr Reset] [Resets the positions and visibility of all of the above to the initial state.]
---

=== Image

--- table.border
[.nbr Rotate] [Rotates the images clockwise.]
[.nbr Mirror] [Mirrors the images.]
[.nbr Global intensity scale] [Displays images with an intensity (colour) scale normalized to the maximum intensity of all images; otherwise the intensity scale is normalized individually for each image.]
[.nbr Link cuts] [Make cuts on all sides equal.]
[.nbr Show overlay] [Shows a layer with additional information on top of the image.]
[.nbr Scale in steps] [Scale image to minimize pixel scaling artifacts.]
[.nbr Show gamma range] [Show the range of currently selected gamma slice.]
---

=== Diffractogram

--- table.border
[.nbr Select regions] [Enables the tool that is used to select background and reflection regions.]
[.nbr Show fitted background] [Shows the background-fitted polynomial.]
[.nbr Clear background regions] [Removes all background regions.]
[.nbr Clear reflections] [Removes all reflections.]
[.nbr Add reflection] [Adds a new reflection to the reflections list.]
[.nbr Remove reflection] [Removes the selected reflection from the reflection list.]
[.nbr All datasets] [Shows the diffractogram of the combination of all selected datasets.]
[.nbr Global intensity scale] [Normalize the diffractogram intensity scale to the maximum intensity of all datasets; otherwise the intensity scale is normalized individually for each diffractogram.]
[.nbr Averaged intensities] [Experimental: Show (or output) intensities averaged in each 2θ bin; otherwise use their simple sum.]
---

=== Output

--- table.border
[.nbr Pole figures…] [Opens a dialog for calculation, display, and output of pole figure data.]
[.nbr Diagrams…] [Opens a dialog for calculation, display, and output of diagram data.]
[.nbr Diffractograms…] [Opens a dialog for calculation, display, and output of diffractogram data. See {:data output|output}.]
---

=== Help

--- table.border
[About &amp; Configuration…] [Shows the 'About' dialog that also contains configuration options.]
[Online documentation…] [A link to these pages.]
[Check for update…] [Checks whether there is an updated Steca version available for download.]

== Panels

The content of the main window is divided into the following panels:
