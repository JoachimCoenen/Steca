= Get and build Steca

Steca is an open-source software (GPLv3). The source code is available from its
public {:GitHub|https://github.com/scgmlz/Steca2} repository:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/scgmlz/STeCa2.git
~~~

== Prerequisites
Steca is written using the {:Qt|http://qt.io/} framework. The only prerequisites
for building Steca from source code are: Qt5.4+, a current C++ compiler that
supports C++11, and a current version of {`cmake}. Thanks to Qt, Steca is a
cross-platform software that can be built and run on Linux(es), Mac OSX, and Windows.

== Building Steca
To build Steca with {`cmake}, the usual process applies, e.g.:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/scgmlz/STeCa2.git
cd STeCa2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
~~~
Alternatively, Steca can be built using {`qmake}. The source contains a shell
script that creates the qmake project (.pro) file:
~~~
cd STeCa2
./make_pro.sh
~~~
and then:
~~~
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
make
~~~
== Releases &amp; Windows

Released versions of Steca are also available on
{:GitHub (releases)|https://github.com/scgmlz/STeCa2/releases}.

. Each release contains archives of a source code snapshot and also a Windows
build of Steca. (It is quite straightforward for users to build Steca on a Linux
or Mac OSX.)

. The Windows build of Steca is a single executable file, staticaly linked with
all required libraries. It does not need any installation {---} simply put the
file into a Windows folder of your choice (or on the desktop) and run it.
